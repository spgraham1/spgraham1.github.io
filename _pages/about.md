I'm Samantha, and I'm a computational biologist / bioinformatician / whichever other term you prefer at the University of Minnesota. I'm currently working on my PhD with [Dr. Ran Blekhman](https://blekhmanlab.org/) and [Dr. Frank Albert](https://albert-lab.org/). My work focuses on the human microbiome, but I've long been fascinated by genetics and genomics. When I was in elementary school, my parents explained my eye color to me using a punnett square, so I was probably doomed to a life in science from the start.

You can find pretty irregular updates from me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/samanthagraham.bsky.social), and even less frequent updates on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-graham-a70841bb/) and [Twitter](https://x.com/samanthapgraham).
