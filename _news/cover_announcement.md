  This cover represents the work we did to catalog 168,000 human gut microbiome samples and organize them into a single dataset. You can see piles of microbes on the floor, representing the sheer amount of microbiome data available. The workers are organizing the data and storing it in continent-shaped bookshelves. The bookshelves for the United States and Western Europe are much fuller than the rest of the world, representing the imbalanced distribution of global microbiome sampling. We worked with SciStories, who did excellent illustration work, to bring our ideas to life for this cover.
