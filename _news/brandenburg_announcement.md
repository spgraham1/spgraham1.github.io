I was selected as a recipient of the [Beatrice Z. Milne and Theodore Brandenburg Award](https://med.umn.edu/about/honors-awards/student-awards/beatrice-z-milne-and-theodore-brandenburg-award), given annually to graduate students in a PhD program at the University of Minnesota Medical School in recognition of exceptional thesis research in the basic biomedical sciences.
